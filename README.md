# Welcome to the CPACC Practice Exam Web Application!

This project is a web-based practice quiz designed to help learners prepare for the IAAP Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) exam. It was developed using Lovable.dev’s Vibe Coding interface, which allows for building functional, beautiful apps using prompt-based logic. I do, however, have coding experienc ein HTM, Java, and Python so I tried my hand at how this platform created programs base don input. This is far fomr perfect but it presents and intersting use case for teaching methodlogy being able to create accessible quizzes on the fly for learners. 

The quiz is built to reflect the IAAP CPACC Body of Knowledge and emphasizes accessibility, personalization, and responsive design. Each time the quiz is taken, 20 random questions are selected from a pool of 100 items, with balanced representation across three key CPACC content areas.

## Development Approach
This project was built using a "Vibe Coding" strategy with Lovable.dev prompts. 

Each feature and behavior was developed through:
- Modular prompt-based design
- Iterative updates based on usability and accessibility testing
- Focus on WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Leveraging ARIA roles for screen reader compatibility
- Personal editing to preserve clean UI/UX styling while honoring functionality for diverse user needs

## Feedback Welcome
This project is still evolving. I welcome feedback, bug reports, and suggestions—especially those that improve:
- User experience across assistive technologies
- Visual clarity and interface customization
- Question formatting or logic alignment with the CPACC Body of Knowledge
- Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion!
